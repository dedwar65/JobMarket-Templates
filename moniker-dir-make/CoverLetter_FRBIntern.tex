\par My name is Decory Edwards and I am going into the 5th year of the Economics PhD program at Johns Hopkins. 
If selected for the internship with the Policy Research and Analytics group at the Board, I am available to start in mid to late January. 

\par My primary motivation for applying for this position is that I would like to learn from and interact with
more economists in the central bank setting. During the third year of my PhD, I completed a year-long internship at the Federal Reserve Board.
In that position, I used a combination of Dynare and Matlab to study a DSGE model allow for climate change under the representative agent assumption.
At the time, I was working with the theory group at Hopkins and was unsure about which subfield I should focus my dissertation on.
Because of this, and the fact that I did the internship remotely and concurrently with my courses, I did not get as much out of the internship as I wanted at the time.

\par Since then, I have focused my research agenda for the rest of my time at Hopkins on heterogenous agent macroeconomics. 
My dissertation advisor, Chris Carroll, is the lead researcher of the econ-ark project, which features a toolkit (HARK) dedicated to solving and simulating these types of models. 
The toolkit is written in python, and Iâ€™ve developed my coding skills significantly since the last time I was an intern. 
If selected for this position, I look forward to learning about what type of questions the Policy Research and Analytics group works on.
A highly desirable outcome would be to develop some research question that I could explore in one of the remaining chapters of my dissertation.
