               solving a wide class of general equilibrium heterogeneous agent
               models with aggregate shocks together with an open source suite
               of codes that implement our algorithms in an easy to use
               toolbox. Our method extends standard linearization techniques
               and is designed to work in cases when inequality matters for the
               dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates. We present two
               applications that analyze a two asset incomplete markets model
               parameterized to match the distribution of income, wealth, and
               marginal propensities to consume. First, we show that our model
               is consistent with two key features of aggregate consumption
               dynamics that are difficult to match with representative agent
               models: (1) the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to
               predictable changes in aggregate income, and (2) the relative
               smoothness of aggregate consumption. Second, we extend the model
               to feature capital-skill complementarity and show how
               factor-specific productivity shocks shape dynamics of income and
               consumption inequality.(This abstract was borrowed from another

                 However, 2007 still remains the watershed year, and median
                 wealth was down 20.4 percent relative to 2007, though mean
                 wealth more than fully recovered. There was a modest remission
                 in wealth inequality, with the share of the top one percent
                 down by 1.4 percentage points, that of the top 20 percent down
                 by 1.0 percentage points, the Gini coefficient down by 0.008,
                 and the mean wealth of the top one percent also down by 1.9
                 percent. The homeownership rate finally rebounded a bit, by
                 1.2 percentage points, to 64.9 percent. The stock ownership
                 rate advanced by 0.4 percentage points to 49.6 percent, though
                 still down from its 2001 peak. Though the mean debt of the
                 middle class rose by 10.7 percent in real terms, the
                 debt-income and debt-net worth ratios remained largely
                 unchanged. The black-white gap in mean net worth remained
                 unchanged, as did the Hispanic-white wealth gap. The wealth of
                 households under age 35 continued to deteriorate in both

               study the persistent-versus-transitory nature of rising

               both before and after taxes, in the United States over the
               period 1987---2009. We apply various statistical decomposition
               methods that allow for different ways of characterizing
               persistent and transitory income components. For male labor
               earnings, we find that the entire increase in cross-sectional
               inequality over our sample period was driven by an increase in
               the dispersion of the persistent component of earnings. For
               total household income, we find that most of the increase in
               inequality reflects an increase in the dispersion of the
               persistent income component, but the transitory component also
               appears to have played some role. We also show that the tax
               system partly mitigated the increase in income inequality, but

@article{daah67,
	abstract = {Economists' use of the term ``equality'' in reference to a distribution of incomes has historically been in the sense of a consensus for some statistical characteristic(s) of the distribution rather than a firm concept of equality. Of course such a concept rests on appropriate welfare assumptions about income and its distribution, assumptions which, for the most part, have been left implicit (and unknown) in discussions of income equality in the literature. Our purpose in this paper is dual: first, we wish to discover an unambiguous, welfare‐related equality measure. This we accomplish through suitable assumptions on a social welfare function. What is produced is an ``index'' of equality which describes the performance of a given distribution relative to the maximum welfare derivable from the total income it represents. The measure thus depends functionally on the welfare attributes of income, something which in reality we know little about. This impasse leads us to inquire into the sensitivity of the index over specifications of the welfare function, which is done by comparing equality ranks for the states of the United States for 1960 under various functional forms and among curves within a given form. As an interesting secondary issue, the performance of traditional equality measures is tested relative to the welfare‐oriented index to discover implications about their welfare content. It is found that the equality index is, in certain ranges for the welfare function, insensitive to its specification. The findings lead directly to conclusions concerning traditional equality measures, their usefulness in correctly accounting for equality differences among alternative income distributions and, concomitantly, their implicit welfare inputs.},

We define a decision maker as decreasing (resp., increasing) absolute ambiguity averse if he becomes less (resp., more) ambiguity averse as he becomes richer. Our definition is behavioral. We provide different characterizations of these attitudes for a large class of preferences: monotone and continuous preferences which satisfy risk independence. We then specialize our results for different subclasses of preferences. Inter alia, our characterizations provide alternative ways to test experimentally the validity of some of the models of choice under uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The main result of this paper is a generalization of the quasilinear mean of Nagumo [29], Kolmogorov [26], and de Finetti [17]. We prove that the most general class of mean values, denoted by $M_{\alpha \phi}$, satisfying Consistency with Certainty, Betweenness, Substitution-independence, Continuity, and Extension, is characterized by a continuous, nonvanishing weight function α and a continuous, strictly monotone value-like function φ. The quasilinear mean $M_{\phi}$ results whenever the weight function α is constant. Existence conditions and consistency conditions with first and higher degree stochastic dominance are derived and an extension of a well known inequality among quasilinear means, which is related to Pratt's [31] condition for comparative risk aversion, is obtained. Under the interpretation of mean value as a certainty equivalent for a lottery, the $M_{\alpha \phi}$ mean gives rise to a generalization of the expected utility hypothesis which has testable implications, one of which is the resolution of the Allais "paradox." The $M_{\alpha \phi}$ mean can also be used to model the equally-distributed-equivalent or representative income corresponding to an income distribution. This generates a family of relative and absolute inequality measures and a related family of weighted utilitarian social welfare functions.},

	abstract = {
John Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core
of the democratic tradition-justice as fairness-and to provide an
alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon
tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls
substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory
account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and
equal persons. \say{Each person,} writes Rawls, \say{possesses an
inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society
as a whole cannot override.} Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant,
Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was
when first published. Though the revised edition of A Theory of
Justice, published in 1999, is the definitive statement of
Rawls's view, much of the extensive literature on his theory refers
to the original. This first edition is available for scholars and
serious students of Rawls's work.

	abstract = {No one has derived closed-form solutions for consumption with stochastic labor income and constant relative risk aversion utility. A numerical technique is used here to give an accurate approximation to the solution. The resulting consumption function is often dramatically different than the certainty equivalence solution typically used, in which consumption is proportional to the sum of financial wealth and the present value of expected future income. The results help explain three important empirical consumption puzzles: excess sensitivity of consumption to transitory income, high growth of consumption in the presence of a low risk-free interest rate, and underspending of the elderly.},

	abstract = {This paper combines income tax returns with Flow of Funds data to estimate the distribution of household wealth in the United States since 1913. We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations' tax records. Wealth concentration has followed a U-shaped evolution over the last 100 years: It was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The rise of wealth inequality is almost entirely due to the rise of the top 0.1% wealth share, from 7% in 1979 to 22% in 2012--a level almost as high as in 1929. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth concentration is due to the surge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of total labor income in the economy. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.},

 abstract = {How important is human capital at the top of the U.S. income distribution? A primary source of top income is private “pass-through” business profit, which can include entrepreneurial labor income for tax reasons. This paper asks whether top pass-through profit mostly reflects human capital, defined as all inalienable factors embodied in business owners, rather than financial capital. Tax data linking 11 million firms to their owners show that top pass-through profit accrues to working-age owners of closely-held, mid-market firms in skill-intensive industries. Pass-through profit falls by three-quarters after owner retirement or premature death. Classifying three-quarters of pass-through profit as human capital income, we find that the typical top earner derives most of her income from human capital, not financial capital. Growth in pass-through profit is explained by both rising productivity and a rising share of value added accruing to owners.},

abstract = {We provide a systematic analysis of the properties of individual returns to wealth using 12 years of population data from Norway's administrative tax records. We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1\%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net-of-tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.},

 abstract = {Top income inequality rose sharply in the United States over the last 35 years but increased only slightly in economies like France and Japan. Why? This paper explores a model in which heterogeneous entrepreneurs, broadly interpreted, exert effort to generate exponential growth in their incomes. On its own, this force leads to rising inequality. Creative destruction by outside innovators restrains this expansion and induces top incomes to obey a Pareto distribution. The development of the world wide web and a reduction in top tax rates are examples of changes that raise the growth rate of entrepreneurial incomes and therefore increase Pareto inequality. In contrast, policies that stimulate creative destruction reduce top inequality. Examples include research subsidies or a decline in the extent to which incumbent firms can block new innovation. Differences in these considerations across countries and over time, perhaps associated with globalization, may explain the varied patterns of top income inequality that we see in the data.},

While there is a large number of existing theories of the Pareto tail of the long-run income distributions, almost none of these address the fast rise in top inequality observed in the data. We show that standard theories, which build on a random growth mechanism, generate transition dynamics that are too slow relative to those observed in the data. We then suggest two parsimonious deviations from the canonical model that can explain such changes: “scale dependence” that may arise from changes in skill prices, and “type dependence,” that is, the presence of some “high-growth types.” These deviations are consistent with theories in which the increase in top income inequality is driven by the rise of “superstar” entrepreneurs or managers.},

Entrepreneurship is an important determinant of capital accumulation and wealth concentration and, conversely, the distribution of wealth affects entrepreneurial choices in presence of borrowing constraints. We construct a model that matches wealth inequality very well, both for entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, and find that more restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth concentration, but also reduce average firm size, aggregate capital and the fraction of entrepreneurs. We also find that voluntary bequests are an important channel that allows some high-ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial activity: with accidental bequests only, there would be fewer large firms, fewer entrepreneurs, and less aggregate capital, but also less wealth concentration.

abstract = {This paper uses the information contained in the joint dynamics of individuals' labor earnings and consumption-choice decisions to quantify both the amount of income risk that individuals face and the extent to which they have access to informal insurance against this risk. We accomplish this task by using indirect inference to estimate a structural consumption–savings model, in which individuals both learn about the nature of their income process and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with which individuals know their own income growth rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data. In implementing indirect inference, we find that an auxiliary model that approximates the true structural equations of the model (which are not estimable) works very well, with negligible small sample bias. The main substantive findings are that income shocks are moderately persistent, systematic differences in income growth rates are large, individuals have substantial amounts of information about their income growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime income risk that individuals perceive is substantially smaller than what is typically assumed in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete markets.},

Through a systematic investigation of models with different preferences, dimensions of ex-ante heterogeneity, income processes and asset structure, we show that the most important factor is the share and type of hand-to-mouth households. One-asset models either feature a trade-off between a high average MPC and a realistic level of aggregate  wealth, or generate an excessively polarized wealth distribution that vastly understates the wealth held by households in the middle of the distribution. Two-asset models that include both liquid and illiquid assets can resolve this tension with a large enough gap between liquid and illiquid returns. We discuss how such return differential can be justified from the perspective of theory and data.},

We build a life-cycle model where housing may act as a commitment device to counteract present biases arising from temptation. We show that the model matches several empirical facts, including the large share of wealthy hand-to-mouth households. We evaluate the effect of the two policies and find that they increase wealth accumulation by 7 and 10\% respectively. Our results demonstrate that these policies not only induce portfolio re-balancing, as emphasized by the previous literature, but also increase savings by making commitment more accessible.},

 abstract = {A wide body of empirical evidence finds that around 25 percent of fiscal stimulus payments (e.g., tax rebates) are spent on nondurable household consumption in the quarter that they are received. To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are "wealthy hand-to-mouth": they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizeable quantities of illiquid assets. They therefore display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard "one-asset" framework. The model's nonlinearities with respect to the size of the rebate, its degree of phasing-out, and aggregate economic conditions have implications for policy design.}

abstract = {I study asset prices in a two-agent macroeconomic model with two key features: limited stock market participation and heterogeneity in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption (EIS). The model is consistent with some prominent features of asset prices, such as a high equity premium, relatively smooth interest rates, procyclical stock prices, and countercyclical variation in the equity premium, its volatility, and in the Sharpe ratio. In this model, the risk-free asset market plays a central role by allowing non-stockholders (with low EIS) to smooth the fluctuations in their labor income. This process concentrates non-stockholders' labor income risk among a small group of stockholders, who then demand a high premium for bearing the aggregate equity risk. Furthermore, this mechanism is consistent with the very small share of aggregate wealth held by non-stockholders in the U.S. data, which has proved problematic for previous models with limited participation. I show that this large wealth inequality is also important for the model's ability to generate a countercyclical equity premium. When it comes to business cycle performance, the model's progress has been more limited: consumption is still too volatile compared to the data, whereas investment is still too smooth. These are important areas for potential improvement in this framework.},

The high MPC arises because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a strong precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts that the aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the shock is distributed across households (depending, e.g., on their wealth, or employment status).},

 abstract = {Intertemporal preferences are difficult to measure. We estimate time preferences using a structural buffer stock consumption model and the Method of Simulated Moments. The model includes stochastic labor income, liquidity constraints, child and adult dependents, liquid and illiquid assets, revolving credit, retirement, and discount functions that allow short-run and long-run discount rates to differ. Data on retirement wealth accumulation, credit card borrowing, and consumption-income comovement identify the model. Our benchmark estimates imply a 40\% short-term annualized discount rate and a 4.3\% long-term annualized discount rate. Almost all specifications reject the restriction to a constant discount rate. Our quantitative results are sensitive to assumptions about the return on illiquid assets and the coefficient of relative risk aversion. When we jointly estimate the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the discount function, the short-term discount rate is 15\% and the long-term discount rate is 3.8\%.},

We distinguish between studies using financial flows, which we call “money earlier or later” (MEL) decisions and studies that use time-dated consumption/effort. Under different structural models, we show how to translate what MEL experiments directly measure (required rates of return for financial flows) into a discount function over utils. We summarize empirical regularities found in MEL studies and the predictive power of those studies. We explain why MEL choices are driven in part by some factors that are distinct from underlying time preferences.},

	abstract = {Rising inequality in the permanent component of labor income, henceforth permanent income, has been a major force behind the secular increase in US labor income inequality. This paper explores the macroeconomic consequences of this rise. First, I show that in many common macroeconomic models{\textemdash}including models with precautionary savings motives{\textemdash}consumption is a linear function of permanent income. This implies that macroeconomic aggregates are neutral with respect to shifts in the distribution of permanent income. Motivated by this neutrality result, I develop novel approaches to test for linearity in US household panel data, which consistently estimate the elasticity of consumption to permanent income in common precautionary savings models. The estimates suggest an elasticity of 0.7, soundly rejecting linearity. To quantify the effects of this deviation from neutrality, I extend a canonical precautionary savings model to include non-homothetic preferences across periods, capturing the idea that permanent-income rich households save disproportionately more than their poor counterparts. The model suggests that the US economy is far from neutral. In the model, the rise in US permanent labor income inequality since the 1970s caused: (a) a decline in real interest rates of around 1\%; (b) an increase in the wealth-to-GDP ratio of around 30\%; (c) wealth inequality to rise almost as rapidly as it did in the data.},

	abstract = {Time preferences are an important determinant of decision-making and are widely measured through hypothetical survey questions. However, the extent to which they offer a good representation of time discounting remains largely unexplored. This paper estimates time preference parameters using a commonly-applied hypothetical elicitation method. We explore whether our estimated parameters correlate with actual and incentivized behaviours related to time preferences. First, we consider the correlation between our hypothetical measures and the result of an incentivised experiment using the unique reference numbers of banknotes as a means of determining an individual's willingness to save money. Individuals are given a banknote and informed that if they chose to retain this specific note for a randomly assigned period of time (2, 7 or 14 days) they will receive a second banknote, in effect doubling their initial endowment. Second, we consider the correlation between hypothetical measures and an individual's observable saving behaviour, including ownership of a savings account and participation in a Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA). Overall, our results show that hypothetically-derived time preference parameters are not significantly correlated with our measures of actual or incentivized behaviour. We explore the extent to which our results are due to limited power and find that a version of our results comparable to the relevant literature can detect effect sizes in line with similar studies. Furthermore, we recognise that our incentivized experiment will be a noisy reflection of time discounting and subject to confounding factors, such as the inherent fungibility of money. We provide ancillary evidence suggesting that our main results remain robust to these considerations and others.},

 abstract = {What is the exact nature of the consumption function? Can this term be defined so that it will be consistent with empirical evidence and a valid instrument in the hands of future economic researchers and policy makers? In this volume a distinguished American economist presents a new theory of the consumption function, tests it against extensive statistical J material and suggests some of its significant implications.Central to the new theory is its sharp distinction between two concepts of income, measured income, or that which is recorded for a particular period, and permanent income, a longer-period concept in terms of which consumers decide how much to spend and how much to save. Milton Friedman suggests that the total amount spent on consumption is on the average the same fraction of permanent income, regardless of the size of permanent income. The magnitude of the fraction depends on variables such as interest rate, degree of uncertainty relating to occupation, ratio of wealth to income, family size, and so on.The hypothesis is shown to be consistent with budget studies and time series data, and some of its far-reaching implications are explored in the final chapter.},

  abstract={This article reviews macroeconomic models with heterogeneous households. A key question for the relevance of these models concerns the degree to which markets are complete. This is because the existence of complete markets imposes restrictions on (i) how much heterogeneity matters for aggregate phenomena and (ii) the types of cross-sectional distributions that can be obtained. The degree of market incompleteness, in turn, depends on two factors: (i) the richness of insurance opportunities provided by the economic environment and (ii) the nature and magnitude of idiosyncratic risks to be insured. First, I review a broad collection of empirical evidence--from econometric tests of \&quot;full insurance,\&quot; to quantitative and empirical analyses of the permanent income (\&quot;self-insurance\&quot;) model that examine how it fits the facts about life cycle allocations, to studies that try to directly measure where economies place between these two benchmarks (\&quot;partial insurance\&quot;). The empirical evidence I survey reveals significant uncertainty in the profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as whether or not these risks have increased since the 1970s. An important difficulty stems from the fact that inequality often arises from a mixture of idiosyncratic risk and fixed (or predictable) heterogeneity, making the two challenging to disentangle. I also discuss applications of incomplete markets models to trends in wealth, consumption, and earnings inequality both over the life cycle and over time, where this challenge is evident. Third, I discuss \&quot;approximate\&quot; aggregation--the finding that some incomplete markets models generate aggregate implications very similar to representative-agent models. What approximate aggregation does and does not imply is illustrated through several examples. Finally, I discuss some computational issues relevant for solving and calibrating such models and I provide a simple yet fully parallelizable },

  abstract = "The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how much,
              household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity amplify
              and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the U.S. Great
              Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using
              data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the
              patterns of household income, consumption and wealth inequality
              before and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how
              households in different segments of the wealth distribution were
              affected by income declines, and how they changed their
              expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn.
              Motivated by this evidence, we study several variants of a
              standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and
              an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
              finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the
              impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the distribution
              features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very
              little net worth that sharply increase their saving (i.e. they
              are not hand-to mouth) as the recession hits. We document that
              both these features are observed in the PSID. We also investigate
              the role that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
              insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
              distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.",

  abstract  = "This paper undertakes an assessment of a rapidly growing body of
               economic research on financial literacy. We start with an
               overview of theoretical research which casts financial knowledge
               as a form of investment in human capital. Endogenizing financial
               knowledge has important implications for welfare as well as
               policies intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge in
               the larger population. Next, we draw on recent surveys to
               establish how much (or how little) people know and identify the
               least financially savvy population subgroups. This is followed
               by an examination of the impact of financial literacy on
               economic decision-making in the United States and elsewhere.
               While the literature is still young, conclusions may be drawn
               about the effects and consequences of financial illiteracy and
               what works to remedy these gaps. A final section offers thoughts
               on what remains to be learned if researchers are to better
               inform theoretical and empirical models as well as public
               policy.",

  abstract    = "How does wealth taxation differ from capital income taxation?
                 When the return on investment is equal across individuals, a
                 well-known result is that the two tax systems are equivalent.
                 Motivated by recent empirical evidence documenting persistent
                 heterogeneity in rates of return across individuals, we
                 revisit this question. With such heterogeneity, the two tax
                 systems have opposite implications for both efficiency and
                 inequality. Under capital income taxation, entrepreneurs who
                 are more productive, and therefore generate more income, pay
                 higher taxes. Under wealth taxation, entrepreneurs who have
                 similar wealth levels pay similar taxes regardless of their
                 productivity, which expands the tax base, shifts the tax
                 burden toward unproductive entrepreneurs, and raises the
                 savings rate of productive ones. This reallocation increases
                 aggregate productivity and output. In the simulated model
                 parameterized to match the US data, replacing the capital
                 income tax with a wealth tax in a revenue-neutral fashion
                 delivers a significantly higher average lifetime utility to a
                 newborn (about 7.5\% in consumption-equivalent terms). Turning
                 to optimal taxation, the optimal wealth tax (OWT) in a
                 stationary equilibrium is positive and yields even larger
                 welfare gains. In contrast, the optimal capital income tax
                 (OCIT) is negative---a subsidy---and large, and it delivers
                 lower welfare gains than the wealth tax. Furthermore, the
                 subsidy policy increases consumption inequality, whereas the
                 wealth tax reduces it slightly. We also consider an extension
                 that models the transition path and find that individuals who
                 are alive at the time of the policy change, on average, would
                 incur large welfare losses if the new policy is OCIT but would
                 experience large welfare gains if the new policy is an OWT. We
                 conclude that wealth taxation has the potential to raise
                 productivity while simultaneously reducing consumption
                 inequality.",

                 Has Middle Class Wealth Recovered?}",
  author      = "Wolff, Edward N",
  abstract    = "Asset prices plunged between 2007 and 2010 but then rebounded
                 from 2010 to 2016. The most telling finding is that median
                 wealth plummeted by 44 percent over years 2007 to 2010. The
                 inequality of net worth, after almost two decades of little
                 movement, went up sharply from 2007 to 2010, and relative
                 indebtedness for the middle class expanded. The sharp fall in
                 median net worth and the rise in overall wealth inequality
                 over these years are largely traceable to the high leverage of
                 middle class families and the high share of homes in their
                 portfolio. Mean and median wealth rebounded from 2010 to 2016,
                 by 17 and 28 percent, respectively. While mean wealth
                 surpassed its previous peak in 2007, median wealth was still
                 down by 34 percent. More than 100 percent of the recovery in
                 both was due to a high return on wealth but this factor was
                 offset by negative savings. Relative indebtedness continued to
                 fall for the middle class from 2010 to 2016, and wealth
                 inequality increased somewhat. The racial and ethnic disparity
                 in wealth holdings widened considerably between 2007 and 2016,
                 and the wealth of households under age 45 declined in relative
